# Contacts store
This is a very basic contacts store used as a training project to highlight architectures principles

## WARNING
The store is not thread safe!

# Highlights
- SOLID
- Clean architecture
- Clear separation of concerns, layers
- Simple code to read and extend (no complex logic here thought). Quick new member onboarding. 
- Unit tested on key layers without the need to instantiate other layers (possibility to cover more layers, like the API for example)
- DRY
- Self documented

# Run

```
go run main.go server
```
